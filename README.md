# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background
* The analysis project is performed to assist Steve on choosing a Green Stock for his parents. His parents are planning to invest into a Green Stock as a part of their portfolio, and would like to perform analyzation on thousands of stocks from last year. The initial code worked well for a dozen of stocks, but fails to satisfactorily perform the necessary calculation with a larger data set. The code would need to be refactored in order to run smoothier to accommodate a larger data set.
